# Mobile Developer Assignment

## Overview

Welcome to the Mobile Developer assignment for Aasakya Digital Technologies Pvt Ltd. This test is designed to evaluate your skills in mobile app development, including UI/UX design, data handling, geolocation, complex data flows, and advanced features. You have *2 days* to complete this assignment.

## Instructions

1. *Fork this repository* to your own GitHub account.
2. *Create a new branch* with your name (e.g., john-doe).
3. Complete the tasks outlined below.
4. *Submit a pull request* to this repository with your completed assignment.

## Tasks

### 1. UI/UX Design

Create a mobile application with a user-friendly interface. The application should include:

- A form to input user details (e.g., name, email, age).
- Validation for the input fields.
- A list to display the entered user details.
- A button to submit the form and save the data.

### 2. Data Handling

Implement functionality to handle data storage and retrieval:

- Store the user details locally on the device (e.g., using SQLite, SharedPreferences, or local storage).
- Retrieve and display the stored user details in the list.

### 3. Geolocation and Mapping

Implement functionality to handle geolocation data and display it on a map:

- *Capture the user's current location* and display it on a map.
- Allow the user to *add markers* to the map at specific locations.
- Store the geolocation data (latitude and longitude) locally.
- Retrieve and display the stored geolocation data on the map.

### 4. Complex Data Flows

Implement functionality to handle complex data flows from different points:

- Create a workflow that involves multiple steps and data transformations.
- For example, data entered in the form should trigger a series of processes, such as validation, transformation, and storage.
- Ensure that the data flows are well-documented and that each step is clearly defined.

### 5. Complex Calculations and Data Manipulation

Implement the following functions to perform complex calculations and data manipulation:

#### a. Statistical Calculations

- *Calculate the average, median, and standard deviation* of numerical data (e.g., ages of users).
- Display these statistical values in the application.

#### b. Data Aggregation and Filtering

- *Aggregate data* based on specific criteria (e.g., group users by age range and calculate the count for each group).
- *Filter data* based on specific criteria (e.g., retrieve all users above a certain age).
- Display the aggregated and filtered data in the application.

### 6. Advanced Features

Implement the following advanced features to enhance the application:

#### a. Push Notifications

- Implement push notifications to alert users about updates or important information.
- Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or a similar service to handle push notifications.

#### b. Background Services

- Implement background services to perform tasks such as data synchronization or periodic updates.
- Ensure that the background services are efficient and do not drain the device's battery.

#### c. Offline Functionality

- Implement offline functionality to allow the application to work without an internet connection.
- Cache data locally and synchronize it with the server when the connection is restored.

### 7. Documentation

Ensure your code is well-documented. Include comments and a brief explanation of your approach in the README file.

## Submission

1. Ensure your code is clean and well-organized.
2. Push your changes to your branch.
3. Create a pull request to the original repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code quality and organization.
- Functionality and correctness of the application.
- Ability to handle UI/UX design, data handling, geolocation, complex data flows, and advanced features.
- Ability to perform complex calculations and data manipulation.
- Adherence to best practices and coding standards.
- Documentation and comments.

Good luck! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
